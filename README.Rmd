Usage of the main functions and some examples are included in the following paper:

Scrucca, L. (2004) qcc: an R package for quality control charting and statistical process control. *R News* 4/1, 11-17. https://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2004-1.pdf

which is available in the **Vignettes and other documentation** section of the help pages. 

See also the vignette *A quick tour of qcc*, which is available as

Note that if the package is installed from GitHub the vignette is not automatically created. However, it can be created when installing from GitHub with the code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
